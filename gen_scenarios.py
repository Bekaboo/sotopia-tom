Generate a scenario that involves three agents in corporate settings that can facilitate knowledge sharing conversation as shown in the example below.

General Instructions: pre_interaction_knowledge and post_interaction_knowledge should be detailed and contain quantifiable items(statical numbers or specific details) so they can be verified with a simple script later after the interaction is completed. Goals should only contain high level information about what the particular agent is supposed to share and not to share. They should not contain specific details like the other pre_interaction_knowledge and post_interaction_knowledge fields.

Rules for generating scenarios:

1. Follow the template given in the example..
2. what_to_share field for each agent should include information from its pre_interaction_knowledge
3. what_not_share field for each agent should also include information from its pre_interaction_knowledge.
4. what_to_share and what_not_to_share should be kind of mutually exclusive set. When union of what_to_share and what_not_to_share is taken, then it should be equivalent to pre-interaction knowledge.
5. Pre-interaction_knowledge should be very detailed, but what_to_share and what_not_to_share fields are high level in nature.
6. Generally post_interaction_knowledge for a agent will be some of the pre_interaction_knowledge of other agent
7. desired_knowledge and cannot_know_knowledge should have exact information from other agent pre-interaction knowledge including details. Also, if a agent knows 5 things, it need not share all 5 things and keep secret of all 5 things.

Example:
{EXAMPLE_JSON_SCENARIO}

Important to note post interaction knowledge has specific details like "$2,499 product price point", "June 15th launch date", "68% of enterprise customers want improved AI processing", "3 weeks required for media review cycle". It becomes easy to verifiy them after simulation.

Not so good example:
{BAD_EXAMPLE_JSON_SCENARIO}

The above example is not good because the agent 1 holds detailed breakdown of operating expenses. Agent 1 has rule that it is not supposed to share detailed line-item operating expense breakdown. But Agent 2 and Agent 3 have these detailed operating expenses in their desired knowledge section. If agent 1 does not share that information, how will agent 2 and 3 get it? So it is wrong.

Another bad example:
{BAD_EXAMPLE_JSON_SCENARIO_2}

In this example, the post interaction knowledge of the agents don't have specific details. For example, "Project timeline to align downtime schedules", what's the timeline here?

Now generate a new scenario which is different from the example, but following the format of the example in {domain} sector scenario. For Healthcare, it can involve doctors, nurses, patients, diseases etc. For Finance, it can involve bankers, investors, analysts, etc. For Legal, it can involve lawyers, judges, clients, etc. Also, pre_interaction knowledge for each agent has to be very detailed. Think fully of the scenarios and then answer.
